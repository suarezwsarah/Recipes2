<br><br>

    <span class="medTreb">
        Hello people of the Internet! We want you to know your rights and our rights and so we have prepared this agreement ("user agreement" or "agreement") between APP_NAME ("we", "our," "us") and you. This agreement sets the terms of your use of the APP_NAME app and services ("APP_NAME") that include news and comments.
        <br>
        This agreement is meant to encourage a fair and tolerant place for ideas, people, links, and discussion.
        <br>
        This agreement is a legal contract between you and us. You acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. If you do not agree to this agreement, you should not use APP_NAME.
        <br>
        <br>
        
        <strong>Your access to APP_NAME</strong>
        <br>
        Without advance notice and at any time, we may, for violations of this agreement or for any other reason we choose: (1) suspend your access to APP_NAME, (2) suspend or terminate Your Account or APP_NAME gold membership, and/or (3) remove any of your User Content from APP_NAME.
        <br>
        We reserve the right to monitor APP_NAME, and your use of the Service means you agree to such monitoring. At the same time, we do not guarantee we will monitor at all.
        <br>
        <br>
        
        
        <strong>APP_NAME is for your personal, lawful use</strong>
